Furthermore, the guided reading sections would have been much more useful if he did not concentrate on explaining only the morphology and lexical meaning of the expressions. We have learnt from studies in the teaching of reading in a second language that the reading competency of second language learners can be significantly enhanced if they are supplied with some contextual information about what they read. 

it would have been even more valuable if those texts were from the English Bible or texts about the history or geography of the Bible. 

Furthermore, one may ask whether it is prudent to expose students to a text linguistic approach of which the theoretical status is questionable.

One may argue that insights from Second Language Learning and taking the availability of electronically tagged texts into consideration could have benefitted this work...

There is a perceptible shift, however, once the derived verbal stems and the weak verbs are reached. Here, the pace quickens with a long, somewhat abstract list of ‘tendencies’ in the treatment of weak letters, so that the qal perfect, then imperfect and so on, of all weak verbs are treated more or less together. 
I suspect that students, who, up to this point, will have become used to mastering the intricacies of spelling in detail, will suddenly become bewildered. 

 This will be accentuated by what I regard as the most regrettable weakness in a serious teaching grammar of this sort
 
  it will have to remain a supplementary text for my own courses.
